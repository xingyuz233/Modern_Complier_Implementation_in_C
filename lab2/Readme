number, e.g. 14302010001.
Second come to the parent directory of 14302010001, and use the following command
"tar cvf 14302010001.tar 14302010001"
to compress it to 12302010001.tar.


Note: Compiling Error means Zero Point.
Make sure that your output is the same as reference output.

WARNING: COPY FROM OTHERS WILL BOTH GET ZERO!
